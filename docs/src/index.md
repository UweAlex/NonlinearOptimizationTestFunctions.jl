# NonlinearOptimizationTestFunctionsInJulia

## Purpose
Provides test functions for nonlinear optimization in Julia, including Rosenbrock and Sphere, with analytical gradients and metadata for use with optimization packages like Optim.jl, NLopt, and others.

## Quick Start
Evaluate test functions:

    using NonlinearOptimizationTestFunctionsInJulia
    rosenbrock([0.5, 0.5]) # Returns 6.5
    sphere([1.0, 1.0]) # Returns 2.0

## Getting Started
See the Installation section for setup instructions, the Test Functions section for available functions, or the Demos section for example scripts.
