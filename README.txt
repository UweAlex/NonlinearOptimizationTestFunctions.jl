# Last modified: 31 July 2025, 12:40 PM CEST

## Welcome to the Ultimate Optimization Test Suite!
Are you looking for the perfect tool to test and benchmark your nonlinear optimization algorithms? Look no further! **NonlinearOptimizationTestFunctionsInJulia** is your one-stop solution, designed specifically for Julia users who demand precision, ease of use, and unmatched flexibility. Whether you're a student exploring optimization for the first time, a researcher benchmarking cutting-edge solvers, or a developer building the next big optimization tool, this package has you covered. 

Why choose our package? Unlike other libraries that may offer outdated implementations or limited compatibility, **NonlinearOptimizationTestFunctionsInJulia** delivers a curated set of 15 rigorously verified test functions, complete with analytical gradients, comprehensive metadata, and seamless integration with Julia’s powerful optimization ecosystem (Optim.jl, NLopt, ForwardDiff, Zygote). Built on the foundational work *Test functions for optimization needs* by Molga and Smutnicki (2005), every function is backed by a trusted source, ensuring scientific accuracy. With an intuitive interface, extensive examples, and active maintenance, this package makes optimization testing accessible, efficient, and even fun!

### Why This Package Stands Out
- **Precision and Reliability**: Every function’s minima, bounds, and gradients are verified against Molga & Smutnicki (2005) and cross-checked with authoritative sources like al-roomi.org.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Step-by-step examples and clear explanations make it easy for anyone to get started, no prior optimization knowledge required.
- **Julia-Optimized**: Designed to leverage Julia’s speed and ecosystem, with perfect compatibility for Optim.jl, NLopt, and automatic differentiation tools.
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Each function includes detailed metadata (e.g., minima, bounds, properties), making it easy to set up and analyze experiments.
- **Future-Ready**: One additional function (Hartmann) is planned, and the package is extensible for your custom needs.
- **Community-Driven**: Join our active community on GitHub to contribute, report issues, or suggest new features!

### Special Note on Ackley Function
The Ackley function uses default bounds [-5, 5]^n to ensure compatibility with our test suite. For standard benchmarking, use `tf.meta[:lb](n, bounds="benchmark")` and `tf.meta[:ub](n, bounds="benchmark")` to set bounds to [-32.768, 32.768]^n, as recommended in the literature.

## Installation: Get Started in Minutes
Setting up **NonlinearOptimizationTestFunctionsInJulia** is a breeze. You need:
- Julia 1.11.5 or higher
- Required dependencies: LinearAlgebra (standard library), Optim, Test, ForwardDiff, Zygote
- Optional: NLopt for advanced optimization scenarios

Install the package with these simple commands:
    using Pkg
    Pkg.activate(".")
    Pkg.instantiate()

This sets up your environment and installs all dependencies. You’re now ready to explore the world of optimization!

## Getting Started: Your First Steps
To begin, load the package:
    using NonlinearOptimizationTestFunctionsInJulia

The package provides 15 test function objects, each ready to challenge your optimization algorithms:
    ROSENBROCK_FUNCTION, SPHERE_FUNCTION, ACKLEY_FUNCTION, AXISPARALLELHYPERELLIPSOID_FUNCTION,
    RASTRIGIN_FUNCTION, GRIEWANK_FUNCTION, SCHWEFEL_FUNCTION, MICHALEWICZ_FUNCTION,
    BRANIN_FUNCTION, GOLDSTEINPRICE_FUNCTION, SHUBERT_FUNCTION, SIXHUMPCAMELBACK_FUNCTION,
    LANGERMANN_FUNCTION, EASOM_FUNCTION, SHEKEL_FUNCTION

You can also access functions via the `TEST_FUNCTIONS` dictionary, using lowercase keys (e.g., `TEST_FUNCTIONS["rosenbrock"]`). Note that keys are case-sensitive, so always use lowercase.

## Anatomy of a Test Function
Each test function object is packed with features to make your life easier:
- **tf.f**: The objective function, taking a vector input (e.g., `[x1, x2]`) and returning a scalar value.
- **tf.grad**: Non-in-place gradient function, returning a new gradient vector, ideal for ForwardDiff and Zygote.
- **tf.gradient!**: In-place gradient function, automatically generated for performance with Optim.jl and NLopt.
- **tf.meta**: A dictionary containing metadata, such as:
    - `:name`: Function name (e.g., "Rosenbrock")
    - `:start`: Function returning a starting point for dimension `n`
    - `:min_position`: Function returning the global minimum position
    - `:min_value`: Scalar or function for the global minimum value
    - `:properties`: List of mathematical properties (e.g., [:unimodal, :nonconvex])
    - `:lb`, `:ub`: Functions returning lower and upper bounds
    - `:in_molga_smutnicki_2005`: Boolean (always true, indicating the source)

## Example Gallery: Learn by Doing
Let’s dive into practical examples to see the package in action. These examples cover everything from evaluating functions to optimizing them with popular Julia libraries.

### Example 1: Evaluating a Function
Compute the value of the Rosenbrock function, a classic test with a narrow valley:
    rosenbrock = ROSENBROCK_FUNCTION
    x = [0.5, 0.5]
    value = rosenbrock.f(x)  # Returns 6.5
    println("Rosenbrock at $x: $value")

### Example 2: Computing Gradients
Calculate the gradient of the Sphere function, perfect for testing basic optimization:
    sphere = SPHERE_FUNCTION
    x = [1.0, 1.0]
    grad = sphere.grad(x)  # Returns [2.0, 2.0]
    println("Sphere gradient at $x: $grad")

For better performance with large dimensions, use the in-place gradient:
    grad_vec = zeros(2)
    sphere.gradient!(grad_vec, x)
    println("In-place Sphere gradient: $grad_vec")

### Example 3: Optimizing with Optim.jl
Optimize the multimodal Ackley function using Optim.jl:
    using Optim
    ackley = ACKLEY_FUNCTION
    x0 = ackley.meta[:start](2)  # Starting point, e.g., [0.0, 0.0]
    result = optimize(ackley.f, ackley.gradient!, x0, LBFGS(), Optim.Options(f_reltol=1e-6))
    println("Ackley minimum at: ", Optim.minimizer(result))
    println("Minimum value: ", Optim.minimum(result))

### Example 4: Optimizing with NLopt
Tackle the Rastrigin function, known for its many local minima, using NLopt:
    using NLopt
    rastrigin = RASTRIGIN_FUNCTION
    opt = Opt(:LD_LBFGS, 2)
    opt.lower_bounds = rastrigin.meta[:lb](2)  # [-5.12, -5.12]
    opt.upper_bounds = rastrigin.meta[:ub](2)  # [5.12, 5.12]
    opt.min_objective = (x, grad) -> begin
        if length(grad) > 0
            rastrigin.gradient!(grad, x)
        end
        rastrigin.f(x)
    end
    opt.ftol_rel = 1e-6
    (min_f, min_x, ret) = optimize(opt, rastrigin.meta[:start](2))
    println("Rastrigin minimum at: $min_x, value: $min_f")

### Example 5: Exploring Metadata
Check the metadata of the Six-Hump Camelback function:
    camel = SIXHUMPCAMELBACK_FUNCTION
    println("Name: ", camel.meta[:name])  # "SixHumpCamelback"
    println("Minimum position: ", camel.meta[:min_position](2))
    println("Minimum value: ", camel.meta[:min_value])  # -1.031628453489877
    println("Bounds: ", camel.meta[:lb](2), " to ", camel.meta[:ub](2))

### Example 6: Handling Errors
What if you provide an invalid input? The package is robust:
    try
        rosenbrock.f([1.0])  # Wrong dimension (n=2 required)
    catch e
        println("Error: ", e)  # Informs user of dimension mismatch
    end

### Example 7: Testing Multiple Dimensions
Some functions are scalable. Try the Griewank function in 3D:
    griewank = GRIEWANK_FUNCTION
    x = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
    value = griewank.f(x)  # Returns ~0.305
    println("Griewank at $x (3D): $value")
    println("Bounds for n=3: ", griewank.meta[:lb](3), " to ", griewank.meta[:ub](3))

## Coming Soon: More Functions!
We’re committed to making this package the most complete test suite available. The following function from Molga & Smutnicki (2005) is planned for future inclusion:
- **Hartmann**: Multimodal, non-convex, non-separable, differentiable (n=3 only). Minimum at [0.114614, 0.555649, 0.852547], value -3.86278214782076. Bounds: [0.0, 1.0]^3.

## Why Choose This Over Other Libraries?
Other test function libraries may offer similar functionality, but they often fall short in key areas:
- **Limited Compatibility**: Many libraries aren’t optimized for Julia’s ecosystem, missing out on tools like Optim.jl or Zygote.
- **Incomplete Metadata**: Few provide the detailed metadata (minima, bounds, properties) that our package includes for every function.
- **Outdated Implementations**: Some rely on old or unverified implementations, while ours are cross-checked with trusted sources.
- **Complex Interfaces**: Other libraries may require extensive setup or coding, whereas ours is plug-and-play with intuitive examples.

With **NonlinearOptimizationTestFunctionsInJulia**, you get a modern, actively maintained package that’s both powerful and easy to use. It’s the gold standard for optimization testing in Julia.

## Tips for Beginners
New to optimization? Here’s how to make the most of this package:
- **Start Simple**: Try the Sphere function to understand basic optimization before tackling complex ones like Schwefel or Shubert.
- **Use Metadata**: Always check `tf.meta[:lb]` and `tf.meta[:ub]` to ensure your inputs respect the function’s bounds.
- **Experiment with Solvers**: Test both Optim.jl and NLopt to see which works best for your problem.
- **Check Errors**: If something goes wrong, the package provides clear error messages to guide you.

## Frequently Asked Questions
- **Why are some functions limited to specific dimensions?** Functions like Branin or Easom are defined only for n=2 in the literature to maintain their standard properties.
